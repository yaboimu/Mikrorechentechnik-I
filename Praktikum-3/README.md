üß© Labyrinth Navigation Project

This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering (Fundamentals) course at Technische Universit√§t Dresden.

üìò Project Description

The goal of the assignment was to:
Load a 2D maze (labyrinth) from a text file,
Represent it using suitable data structures in Python,
Visually render the maze using a graphical module,
Identify the start and end points, and
Implement a simple pathfinding algorithm to navigate an avatar from start to goal.
The implementation was divided into several modules, including:
- Data loading and normalization
- Maze visualization (using colors for walls, paths, start, and goal)
- Pathfinding logic (using right-hand rule navigation)
- Main program integration and optional extensions

üß† Key Learning Objectives

Strengthening Python programming concepts (lists, loops, modular design)
Developing teamwork and structured software design skills
Practicing debugging and testing without frameworks
